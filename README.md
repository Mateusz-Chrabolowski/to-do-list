# My to-do-list Mateusz Chrabolowski
## My to-do-list is working by write a text in [ dodaj nowe zadanie ] and then press a [Dodaj zadanie] and it will render bellow in  [Lista zadan do wykonania]. You have 2 option to press a green button which mean that you made your activity or red one which mean that you delated your activity or didn't do it. To create this projekt i use my knowladge in java script, css, and html file. And i think the projekts looks good.
